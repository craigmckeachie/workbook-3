RedOne, Konvict
GaGa, oh, eh

I've had a little bit too much, much (oh, oh, oh)
All of the people start to rush (start to rush by)
A dizzy twister dance, can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone (oh, oh, oh)

What's goin' on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore (woo!)
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright

Just dance, gonna be okay, da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance, spin that record, babe, da da doo-doo-mmm
Just dance, gonna be okay, d-d-d-dance
Dance, dance, just, j-j-just dance

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth (oh, oh, oh)
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? (Inside out, right)
